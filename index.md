OpenNEC is a free and open-source Train Simulator Classic mod that greatly enhances the functionality of passenger locomotives released for the Northeast Corridor (Washington, D.C. to Boston) locale. It's a complete rescripting effort, using code written from scratch, to achieve an ultra-realistic driving experience.

## Drive easier with quality of life improvements.

A scrolling menu for changing destination signs. A progress bar for switching dual-power locomotive modes. Automatic bell when blowing the horn. And, oh, did we mention fading ditch lights?

## Safety systems? We have safety systems.

The mod includes complete implementations of the two safety systems in use on the corridor. Amtrak's Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES) finally gets a proper rendition, with a braking curve that provides advance warning of any reduction in the track speed limit.

Automatic Train Control (ATC), which enforces the cab signal speed, is delightfully bug-free and is universally compatible--no longer do you need to switch it off just because your consist didn't ship with the route DLC you're driving. A must-have if you play scenarios from the scenario packs or the Steam Workshop.

## Plays nice with other community content.

The mod is fully compatible with Fan Railer's popular physics and sound enhancement packs. Plus, it sends the consist messages needed to power the next generation of community content, like the [Amfleet I Enhancement Pack](https://www.trainsimcommunity.com/mods/c1-train-sim-classic/c77-enhancement-packs/i3499-amfleet-i-enhancement-pack) and [Ragno's Viewliners](https://www.trainsimcommunity.com/mods/c1-train-sim-classic/c87-models/i1529-amtrak-viewliner-ii-baggages).
