Open NEC is a free and open-source Train Simulator Classic mod that greatly enhances the functionality of passenger locomotives released for the Northeast Corridor (Washington, D.C. to Boston) locale. It's a complete rescripting effort, using code written from scratch, to achieve an ultra-realistic driving experience.

## Drive easier with quality of life improvements.

A scrolling menu for changing destination signs. A progress bar for switching dual-power locomotive modes. Automatic bell when blowing the horn. And, oh, did we mention fading ditch lights?

## Safety systems? We have safety systems.

The mod includes complete implementations of the two safety systems in use on the corridor. Amtrak's Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES) finally gets a proper rendition, with a braking curve that provides advance warning of any reduction in the track speed limit.

Automatic Train Control (ATC), which enforces the cab signal speed, is delightfully bug-free and is universally compatible--no longer do you need to switch it off just because your consist didn't ship with the route DLC you're driving. A must-have if you play scenarios from the scenario packs or the Steam Workshop.

## Plays nice with other community content.

The mod is fully compatible with Fan Railer's popular [physics and sound enhancement packs](https://www.nyctarailfan.com/frtscmodifications). Plus, it sends the consist messages needed to power the next generation of community content, like the [Amfleet I Enhancement Pack](https://www.trainsimcommunity.com/mods/c1-train-sim-classic/c77-enhancement-packs/i3499-amfleet-i-enhancement-pack) and [Ragno's Viewliners](https://www.trainsimcommunity.com/mods/c1-train-sim-classic/c87-models/i1529-amtrak-viewliner-ii-baggages).
